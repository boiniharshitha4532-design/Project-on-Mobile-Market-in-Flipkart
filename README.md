# 📱 Flipkart Mobile Data Analysis (Web Scraping + EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

While learning Data Analytics, I wanted to go beyond clean, pre-structured datasets and work on a real-world business problem using live marketplace data.

With hundreds of smartphones listed on Flipkart, customers often struggle to decide:

- Bigger battery?
- Better processor?
- Higher price?
- Better ratings?

But the real question is:

> *Which phone actually offers the best value for money?*

This project analyzes real-world Flipkart mobile data to understand how price, brand, processor, battery, storage, and ratings influence purchasing decisions.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Mobile specifications are spread across product pages in mixed formats, making comparison difficult.

Customers often struggle to understand:

- Which brand dominates the marketplace?
- Does a higher price always mean better ratings?
- Which processor segment is most common?
- Do bigger batteries increase price?
- Which brand offers the best value in budget & mid-range?

## 🔍 My Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Collection (Web Scraping)

- Scraped live mobile listing data using Requests & BeautifulSoup
- Extracted 900+ mobile listings
- Collected:
  - Brand  
  - Price  
  - Original Price  
  - Ratings  
  - Battery (mAh)  
  - Storage (GB)  
  - Processor  
  - Warranty

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Real-world data is messy. Cleaning was a major part of this project.

- Converted mixed text fields (₹ price, mAh battery, GB storage) into numeric format  
- Removed duplicate entries  
- Handled missing values  
- Treated price outliers using the IQR method  
- Standardized column names  
- Created derived columns for better insights  

---

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed:

- Univariate Analysis (Price distribution, brand frequency)  
- Bivariate Analysis (Battery vs Price, Price vs Ratings)  
- Multivariate Analysis  
- Correlation Heatmaps  
- Brand-level comparisons  
- Segment-based price categorization  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Budget & mid-range segment (₹5,000–₹30,000) dominates the market  
- Price distribution is positively skewed with few premium outliers above ₹60,000  
- 50MP cameras and 5000–6000mAh batteries are now standard in mid-range phones  
- Moderate correlation between price, storage, and ratings  
- Strong correlation (0.87) between price and original price  
- Realme & Samsung lead in total listings  
- Apple dominates the premium segment with highest average price  
- Higher price does NOT always guarantee better ratings
